My PHP 5.4 Framework try !

## On development ...

The framework Song : [Chic Song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g6bUe5MDRo)

Once you have PHP 5.4 available
* Clone this repository
* Use the command : php -S localhost:7777 -t path/to/Chic/public/
* Then open a browser and goto : http://localhost:7777
* It works like a charm !

## Done
* Use of composer
* Follow PSR-0 convention
* Use Behat to tests
* Chic :
** Config : a static class which read config files and allow y to define specific environment files
** I18n : a static class which translate strings into the (default | defined) language. String can content variables.

## Todo
* So much to list, i don't have time
